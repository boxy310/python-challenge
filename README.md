Solutions for the Python Challenge, a riddle-based programming program for Python. From the website's About page:

"Python Challenge is a game in which each level can be solved by a bit of (Python) programming. The Python Challenge was written by Nadav Samet. All levels can be solved by straightforward and very short scripts. Python Challenge welcomes programmers of all languages. You will be able to solve most riddles in any programming language, but some of them will require Python."

About the files:
-HTML files correspond to a page on the Python Challenge website (http://www.pythonchallenge.com/). 
-Python files (.py) are solutions. Solution generally corresponds to the .html file of the same name. I didn't retain my earliest efforts because they were relatively straightforward, and the formatting was quite rough.
-Other files are supplemental, usually files downloaded to analyze.
-Still in process. Will add updates as I progress in the program.
